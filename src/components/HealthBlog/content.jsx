                    <h4>What are some common health and hygiene products for women?</h4>
                    <p>
                        Common women’s care products include lotions, pads, pantyliners, and tampons, which also help preserve menstrual hygiene. It is recommended for women to use pads and tampons produced from natural absorbent fibres, such as cotton as they are absorbent and yet not harsh on the skin or the environment.

                    <h4>Do women’s multivitamins have any side effects?</h4>
                    <p>Common side-effects of multivitamins may include constipation, diarrhoea, and stomach distress. The side-effects are usually transient and should go away as your body adjusts to the drug. If the symptoms persist or worsen, you should speak to a medical professional.</p>

                    <h4>Which feminine hygiene product is best?</h4>
                    <p>Deciding which feminine hygiene product is best is a deeply personal choice. Each product has its own advantages. Sanitary pads, which have been sold around the world for decades are easily accessible, but not always environmentally-friendly, and can be uncomfortable to wear. Tampons take some time to get used to, and some people may find them unsanitary in comparison with pads. Menstrual cups are hygienic if used correctly, and are a great way to reduce environmental waste. However, fears around how to use the product may prevent women from adopting it.</p>
